      <h1> <p>Ni Mil</p>
      Ni Mil is the spirit of displacement.
A spirit that belongs nowhere,
Living here but remembers there.

Defined by routes and mobility,
it dwells in several places at once
Unable to adhere to any location,
straddling between conflicting dispositions.
Unable to build any foundations.

The problem with navigating between two or more cultures,
lies in the inability to really belong anywhere fully;
and burdened by this incapacity,
the spirit stays on the move,always looking,
Searching endlessly.

It goes around attaching itself to those living away from home,
covering their eyes & enveloping them with an overwhelming feeling of incompleteness.
I was only 11 when it first came to visit.

The spirit dispersed its identity.
 originating from the loss of its motherland,
Which damned it to perpetually look for ways to feel whole again

Usually not long after “Ni Mil” takes hold of you,
“Isi Hi Nyan” will make an appearance too,
